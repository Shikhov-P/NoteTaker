# NoteTaker
This simple app allows adding notes.
It doesn't leverage all power of Node's non-blocking, event-driven I/O and thus is just a template for more complex scenarios. 

## Technology stack:
Node JS, the JS run-time environment
Express, the Node JS back end framework
Mustache, the web template system
MongoDB, the NoSQL database
Monk, the abstraction layer for ineracting with a mongo db
